# Happiness-score-of-IITJ-students-using-Machine-Learning-Models
Firstly, a data set of 156 samples and 25 attributes is collected through google form from IITJ students. Then its cleaning and required preprocessing for our project is done using python. The main aim of our project is to predict the happiness score depending upon the remaining 24 attributes. 

So, we used different techniques to find the correlation between 24 features, and selected the most relevant features. Then simple linear regression is applied on some selected features and multilevel linear regression is applied to the most 14 relevant features received after checking the coefficient matrix. After that using principal component analysis, we have found 9 most high variance features and applied multilevel linear regression over those features. After that we again reduced these features to 4 and reduced the number of classes into 4. Then applied support vector machine, neural networks for classification. We finally, compared these techniques using mean square error, accuracy score, and other measures to friend best result.
